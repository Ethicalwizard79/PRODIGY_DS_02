Titanic Passenger Analysis - Data Cleaning and EDA

This project explores the well-known Titanic passenger dataset, focusing on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). 

**Objective:**

* Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
* Identify patterns and trends in passenger survival rates.
* Explore relationships between variables like passenger class, age, sex, and fare.

**Results:**

Data cleaning techniques were applied to address missing values and inconsistencies. Exploratory data analysis was then conducted to uncover insights about passenger demographics and their impact on survival rates. 

**Key Findings:**

* (Replace this with 2-3 key findings from your EDA, like correlation between passenger class and survival)

**Data Visualization:**

While the detailed visualizations are not included here, you can find them on my LinkedIn feed: [Your LinkedIn Profile URL] (replace with your actual URL)

These visualizations explore various aspects of the data, including:

* Distribution of passenger characteristics.
* Survival rates across different passenger classes.
* Correlations between variables.

**Future Work:**

This project provides a foundational understanding of the Titanic dataset. Further exploration could involve:

* Building predictive models to estimate passenger survival rates.
* Investigating the impact of other factors like embarkation point and cabin class.

This README provides a brief overview of the project. The linked visualizations on your LinkedIn profile offer a deeper look into the data analysis.
